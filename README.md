# MealMate
An app that brings students and cooking together!

## Description: 
MealMate is a mobile application aimed directly at students who live on a tight budget when it comes to food. It provides useful insights in cooking foods that are both efficient and cheap. Through using the available data on cook books, recipes, and online grocery stores, the app will suggest different types of meals for a student to prepare easily at home. The student would need to enter their ingredients, and the app will suggest a meal based on the ingredients available and add/suggest more with affordable prices to complete the recipe. While suggesting meals, the app will also take the weekly spending limit of a student in consideration, and will even plan the meals accordingly to this limit.
