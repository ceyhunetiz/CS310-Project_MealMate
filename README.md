# MealMate
An app that brings students and cooking together!

## Description: 
MealMate is a mobile application aimed directly at students who live on a tight budget when it comes to food. It provides useful insights in preparing recipes that are both healthy and cheap. Through using the available data on cook books, recipes, and online grocery stores, the app will suggest different types of meals for a student to prepare at home. The way the app would work is that essentially, the student would enter their available ingredients, which then the app would either come up with a recipe with those ingredients or add some exra ingredients through the available online markets like Migros. While suggesting meals, the app will also take the weekly spending limit of a student in consideration, and will even plan the meals accordingly to this limit.
